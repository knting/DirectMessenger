Assignment 5 creates a direct messaging system that allows users to communicate with each other on the DSP platform through a graphical user interface (GUI). In the Direct Messaging Protocol Implementation (Part 1), the protocol enables sending and receiving direct messages between users on the DSP platform. In Part 2, the DS Direct Messenger Module, I edited the DirectMessage and DirectMessenger class to implement the same functionalities for sending messages, retrieving new messages, and retrieving all messages from ds_client in Part 1. In part 3, I stored the profile information locally in a DSU to enable users to use the program without internet connection to retrieve previously received messages.

In Part 4, the Graphical User Interface (GUI) provides a user-friendly interface for composing, sending, and viewing messages. It includes features such as a message display window, contact list, message input field, and buttons for sending messages and adding new contacts. The GUI automatically retrieves new messages automatically while the program is running.
